# dRAGon
A retrieve and generate assistant for tabletop RPGs

## Function

The dRAGon system will assist looking up TTRPG rules, increasing the speed and accuracy (adherence to the rulebook).
Often a GM, while running a game, will be in a position where they either spend time looking up the appropriate rule
to adjudicate a situation, or they will need to make an on the spot ruling. There is nothing wrong with either of these
approaches, but dRAGon will reduce the cost of determining how a GM would rule if they consulted the appropriate rulebooks.

Of course, it is stll up to the GM how they will rule in such a case.

## Critical Features

- dRAGon will answer generic questions about rules. e.g. "What are the rules fighting in difficult terrain" or "What story phase
comes net after the introductory phase?"
- dRAGon will answer questions with provided context. This may take two forms:
-- "My players did...
What would you rule?" Or
-- A transcript of what the players have been doing.

## Long Term Goals

The long term goal of dRAGon is to be a modular component of a suite of AI-assisted TTRPG rules, known as autodragon.
The goal of autodragon is to have the capability to simulate as many parts of the TTRPG experience as possible, and to
allow the replacement of AI with human components and vice versa in real time. For example, a fully realized autodragon
suite would allow a GM of a game to take a day off, or even a minute or hour off, and allow an AI to seamlessly take their place.
The same principle applies to players, rulings, changing character state, simulation of NPCs, simulation of the 'world state', and
simulation of the the 'plot'.

The breakdown of different autodragon components will be described at a later date.
